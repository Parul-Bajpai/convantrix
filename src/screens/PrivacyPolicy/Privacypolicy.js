            expressed their permission to receive communications from them.
            Additionally, Convantrix services may only be used for lawful
            purposes and may not violate any local, state, federal or
            international laws.

            Policy that each of our clients are contractually bound to.

            users availing our services and it reduces bounces and ensures high
            deliverability.
